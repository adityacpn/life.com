<p>A teenager, or teen, is a young person whose age falls within the range from 13â€“19. They are called teenagers because their age number ends with "teen".</p>

<p>Usage by ordinary people varies, and also varies in different societies. Most societies traditionally had a formal ceremony to mark the change from childhood to adulthood. During puberty, rapid mental and physical development occurs. Adolescence is the name for this transition period from childhood to adulthood.</p>

<p>In the United States, teenagers from the ages 13-14 go to middle school while teenagers from the ages of 14-18 typically go to high school. In the United Kingdom (UK); teenagers and non-teens are mixed in secondary school. Teenagers attending secondary school (high school in the US) generally graduate at the age of 17 or 18.
