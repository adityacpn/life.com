How do you deal with your problems? Maybe you try to solve them systematically, maybe you turn to others for help, or maybe you just run away from them. Regardless of the approach taken, many of us may find that some of the problems we face just do not go away no matter how much we try. The reason for this is that unknown to most of us, up to 80% of the problems that we face in life have their root cause in the spiritual dimension. These problems can include financial problems, marital disharmony, depression, miscarriages, and chronic illnesses. For example, if most of the family is suffering from financial problems, it can indicate ancestral problems since the whole family shares the same ancestors. Just like this, other spiritual factors such as destiny or negative energy problems can be at the root of the problems we face. Modern science only looks at the physical and psychological factors of a problem but fails to see how spiritual factors play an important role. Problems that have their root cause in the spiritual dimension can only be overcome with a spiritual solution. SSRF recommends doing spiritual practice because this addresses the spiritual root cause of our problems. Many seekers around the world have experienced how doing spiritual practice has improved the quality of their lives and how it has helped them to overcome their problems.
