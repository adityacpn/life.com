<li>Daily Problems:-</li><br>
<p>The biggest problem people face everyday is just handling themselves everyday. These days the enemy is not present in another country or family. The enemy is present inside us. So we are our own enemy. We need to be steady in thought word and deed which is the definition of a true mahatma like Gandhiji. Now having said that, the media and smart phone are our biggest impediments to complete any task or thought to fruition. Before I even start one task, I have several messages popping up in my Facebook and Whatsapp accounts. I would have reached the phone to speak to my mother about her health and welfare but I get diverted into this fb post and Whatsapp messages to a point that I forget why I took the phone on hand. The whole working hour passes in the same fashion as a result of which only frustration builds up very heavily. Nowadays the funda is to keep talking endlessly, listening to music endlessly, watching videos and Facebook posts all day. This type of multi- wasting is causing infinite wastage. Note that Facebook and Whatsapp are not multi-tasking they are multi-wasting of precious productive time. Agreed that lots of businesses happen over fb and Whatsapp but somehow the businesses before had a better definition and was more organised. There is always a carryover in the mind. Before one problem is finished there are several pinged on you from all directions. You are always on your toes and the brain is forever stimulated. You just don't get to rest the brain.</p>
<li>Lifetime Problems:-</li><br>
<p>Life is full of problems, but how we approach those problems often determines whether we’re happy or miserable. Bob Maynard says, “Problems are opportunities in disguise.” If we approach problems with Maynard’s attitude, we see that problems are really opportunities to learn about others and ourselves. They enable us to live happier and more fulfilling lives. </p>

<p>Maynard’s quote applies to all kinds of problems. I faced a problem just last week when our family’s kitchen sink developed a serious leak. There was water all over our kitchen floor and piles of dishes to be washed. But our landlord was out of town for the week. I come from a big family-I have six brothers and sisters-so we couldn’t afford to wait until he got back, and my mom couldn’t afford a couple hundred dollars to pay for a plumber on her own. So I took the opportunity to learn how to fix it myself. I went to the library and found a great fix-it-yourself book. In just a few hours, I figured out what was causing the leak and how to stop it. If it weren’t for that problem, I probably would have relied on plumbers and landlords all my life.
